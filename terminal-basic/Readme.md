## Terminal Basic

A browser startpage heavily inspired by an original design by kopri@unixhub.net (which can be found [here](https://startpages.github.io/startpages/Startpage_kopri-nb/))

No code was shared between the two. I treated this as a practice exercise. Everything was done from scratch.

## Theming

the following color schemes are supported

1. Solarized Dark
2. Gruvbox Dark
3. Cyberpunk
4. material ocean

In order to change the Theme simply press the ``cycle_themes`` button and a theme will randomly be chosen.

## todo

- add music embed
- overhaul styling
- allow switchable themes (done)
- better link organization/addition and deletion
- bookmark search?
- improve search bar
- animations
- add icon

## note

this was only tested with firefox quantum.
